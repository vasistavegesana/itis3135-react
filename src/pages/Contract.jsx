    <p>
      I, Vasista Vegesana, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2025 ITIS 3135 Web Design and
      Development with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.

      I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly
      available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork,
      or that I wish to keep private.
